# Neural-Style-Transfer
This repo contains the implementation of original neural style transfer algorithm

# Testing
To run this program on your sample content-style pair, just replace the content and style image of the repo with the image of your choice having the same name. the program will run 4000 iterations and output the resultant ater every 500th execution. You can edit these details in the file containing the code.

To perform style transfer run: `python styleTransfer.py`
